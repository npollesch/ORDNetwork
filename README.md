Exploring Added Network Connectivity By Subgrouping Strategies by NPollesch

ORDNetwork explores three different grouping strategies for how to optimally group members of
a heirarchical organization so that the new groups minimize total distance in the organization.

A greedy algorithm used maximum distances in the graph to group inidividuals
An anti-greedy algorithm used minimum distance to group as a comparison
A random algorithm grouped inidivudals, uniformly randomly from amoung the organization.

Initial results showed that random grouping to was nearly as effective as the greedy algorithm and was
significantly easier to implement.  For the actual grouping exercise that motivated the project, a random algorithm 
was paired with two metrics for evenness to ensure group distance was minimized and a mixture of upper and lower
management was achieved in each subgroup.

See the "Mix the managers" version of the .docx for the final project summary.
